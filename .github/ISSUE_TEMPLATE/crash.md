Thanks for creating an issue! You can paste your code into http://decaffeinate-project.org/repl/ and then copy the URL to get a shareable link to your code. Pasting that URL into the issue as a markdown link is helpful, like so:

    [(repl)](http://decaffeinate-project.org/repl/#?evaluate=true&code=a%20b)
